## Gregory Walsh

![Photo of me](/aboutme.png)

My name is Greg Walsh, and this is my personal blog. My hope is to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on various topics, including technology, programming, and personal development.

I am a PKI Security Engineer for the FAA ✈️ and help run a small MSP (Managed Service Provider) on the side. I also teach Java and Python Programming courses at Stockton University. I have a passion for technology and enjoy exploring new tools and techniques to improve my skills. I also love to share my knowledge with others, whether through teaching or writing.

I went to Stockton University and graduated with a M.S in Data Science & Strategic Analytics and a B.S. in Computer Science. I also have a BIG-IP F5 certification and a few other certifications in the works.

I am a huge fan of open source software and believe in the power of community-driven projects. I utilize open source tools everyday (this blog is open source!)

I'm glad you are here and I hope you find something useful or interesting on my blog. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gregwalsh96) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregwalsh96/).

Most Importantly:

I make what I love.

I love what I do.
