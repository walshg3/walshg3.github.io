My name is **Greg Walsh**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am a Graduate Student in the *Data Science and Strategic Analytics* program at [Stockton University](https://stockton.edu/graduate/data-science_strategic-analytics.html). I majored in Computer Science during my undergrad at [Stockton University](https://www.stockton.edu/), and I am currently focusing on Data Science and Machine Learning for my Graduate Degree. 

The purpose of this website is to show work done in an Independent Study on Machine Learning during my Senior Year of my undergraduate degree. The blog will also serve as a page to show what tech I am currently working on as well as a online resume. 

**Most Importantly**

I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*
