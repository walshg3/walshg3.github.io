>&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;

It has been a long-time dream of mine to create a blog and personal website. A place to share my opinions and perspectives on technology as well as life in general. A blog that no one will ever read except for myself years from now. Originally, the blog was created as a stepping stone to show I am proficient with web-based frameworks however, I believe it will grow into much more. My hope is to use this blog as a way to discuss the Machine Learning independent study I am working on as well as a way to discuss important parts of my life. I am in no way good at grammar and forming sentences, so I apologize to readers, employers, and my future self ahead of time. Until Next time!
